A Trie data structure is used for storing and retrieval of data and the same operations could be done using another data structure which is Hash Table but Trie data structure can perform these operations more efficiently than a Hash Table. Moreover, Trie has its own advantage over the Hash table. A Trie data structure can be used for prefix-based searching and a sorted traversal of all words. So a Trie has advantages of both hash table and self balancing binary search trees. However the main issue with Trie is extra memory space required to store words and the space may become huge for long list of words and/or for long words.
